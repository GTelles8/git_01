## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

How doth the little crocodile  
     Improve his shining tail,  
And pour the waters of the Nile  
     On every golden scale!  

How cheerfully he seems to grin,  
     How neatly spreads his claws,  
And welcomes little fishes in,  
     With gently smiling jaws!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In numbers' dance, a story unfolds,  
Statistics whisper tales, both young and old.  
They quantify the world with precision and grace,  
Revealing patterns in every time and space.  

With mean and median, they seek to find,  
The center of the data, a truth confined.  
Standard deviation, a measure of spread,  
Tells how far the values from the mean have fled.  

Regression lines, they chart the way,  
Predicting futures, come what may.  
In histograms and bar graphs, they appear,  
Visualizing trends, crystal clear.  

But beware the pitfalls, for they abound,  
In Simpson's paradox, truth can be drowned.  
And randomness, it plays its part,  
In statistical analysis, it's an art.  

So, embrace the numbers, let them guide,  
Through uncertainty and doubt, they'll be your tide.  
In this world of data, they're your allies true,  
Statistics, the storytellers, forever anew.
