## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

How doth the little crocodile  
     Improve his shining tail,  
And pour the waters of the Nile  
     On every golden scale!  

How cheerfully he seems to grin,  
     How neatly spreads his claws,  
And welcomes little fishes in,  
     With gently smiling jaws!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Nature’s first green is gold,  
Her hardest hue to hold.  
Her early leaf’s a flower;  
But only so an hour.  
Then leaf subsides to leaf.  
So Eden sank to grief,  
So dawn goes down to day.  
Nothing gold can stay.  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In numbers' dance, a story unfolds,  
Statistics whisper tales, both young and old.  
They quantify the world with precision and grace,  
Revealing patterns in every time and space.  

With mean and median, they seek to find,  
The center of the data, a truth confined.  
Standard deviation, a measure of spread,  
Tells how far the values from the mean have fled.  

Regression lines, they chart the way,  
Predicting futures, come what may.  
In histograms and bar graphs, they appear,  
Visualizing trends, crystal clear.  

But beware the pitfalls, for they abound,  
In Simpson's paradox, truth can be drowned.  
And randomness, it plays its part,  
In statistical analysis, it's an art.  

So, embrace the numbers, let them guide,  
Through uncertainty and doubt, they'll be your tide.  
In this world of data, they're your allies true,  
Statistics, the storytellers, forever anew.
